Hi there HAGJ8 judges,

My game is named game.exe and it's in the folder called dist.
game.py contains the source code and the assets folder has all the images sounds and other supporting files.
Let me know if you have any trouble running the game.
My email is silas.raye@gmail.com and my discord handle is AeronautAce.
Good luck, and I hope you enjoy my game!
